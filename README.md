About the Molecular Communication repositories:
During my mentorship under a Bioinformatics PhD student researching the above topic, I programmed a biological simulation in Java to test my understanding of molecular communication and Java skills. They are split into two simulations: one is a simple version where molecules move randomly in and out of cells on a pre-determined grid, while the other utilises differential equations relating to molecular concentrations to dictate the movement of molecules in and out of cells.
